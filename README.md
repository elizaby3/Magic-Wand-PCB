# Magic Wand PCB
## Main Purpose

I routed and designed the schematic in Altium Circuitmaker based off of a Harry Potter Wand as my first PCB project as shown below. During this process, I had to research and choose my own parts based on the footprint of each piece and the price.

Additionally, I added equations, data sheets, and notes to explain the 555 timer that I used.

### 2D PCB Layout:

In this PCB, I used a two layer board with a ground fill on both sides.
